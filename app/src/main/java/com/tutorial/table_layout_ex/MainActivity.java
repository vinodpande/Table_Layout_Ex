 TableLayout will position its children elements into rows and columns and
 it wonâ€™t display any border lines for rows, columns or cells.

 The TableLayout in android will work same as HTML table and table will have as many columns as the row with the most cells.
 The TableLayout can be explained as <table> and TableRow is like <tr> element.
